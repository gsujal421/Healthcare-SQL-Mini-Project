# 🏥 Healthcare SQL Mini Project

## 📘 Overview
This project simulates SQL-driven business analysis for a hospital database. It focuses on extracting actionable insights to support operational strategy, revenue optimization, and patient journey mapping. The dataset includes tables like `patients`, `appointments`, `billing`, `doctors`, and `medical procedures`.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Analyze patient appointment patterns and seasonal demand
- Track departmental revenue and procedure-level profitability
- Detect high-performing doctors based on appointment volume
- Identify inactive patients for re-engagement campaigns
- Calculate Patient Lifetime Value (PLTV) metrics
- Uncover billing outliers and optimize treatment flows

## 🧪 SQL Modules Used
| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Monthly Appointment Count` | Tracks demand fluctuation across months |
| `Top Doctor Performance` | Ranks doctors based on appointment volume |
| `Revenue by Procedure & Department` | Identifies high-earning segments |
| `Repeat Visit Detection` | Highlights frequent visitors for VIP targeting |
| `PLTV Calculation` | Measures lifetime revenue per patient |
| `Inactive Patient Identification` | Flags patients with no activity in 6 months |
| `Procedure Cost Outliers` | Spots anomalies in medical billing |
